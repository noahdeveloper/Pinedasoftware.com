                &emsp;&emsp;My journey as a software developer began at the age of 21 while on my path towards another career.
                I originally wanted to become a mechanical engineer, so naturally I began reading up on
                robotics. I figured that if I was going to become a mechanical engineer, I might as well
                learn how to build simple robots. The book I chose dedicated one of its chapters to
                software; it went on to explain how software is almost always the single most important aspect
                of any system. I dropped the book, I dropped my pursuit of mechanical engineering and I began
                to submerge myself in the world of software development. I figured that if I ever wanted to
                make a real difference in the world, I needed an efficient way to express my ideas, and I
                thought to myself, “what better way to express great ideas than through software?”. At the time
                I was working as an engineer assistant at a manufacturing facility, which I had originally been
                hired for as to be an assembly-line plumbing technician. Fortunately for me, I had already worked with the on-site
                software developer on a handful of projects. I began to seek him out and pick at his brain on
                concepts I didn't have understand; he later became my first career mentor. I began to fall
                in love with software. I couldn’t get enough of it. I would spend endless hours learning
                object-oriented programming with Java and eventually moved onto front-end development. After
                many hours of frustration and helplessness I began to gain the confidence to make the decision
                of pursuing software development as a career and not just a hobby. It was at this point that my
                mentor, at that time, decided I was ready for ASP.NET and the .NET framework. I was overwhelmed
                at first, but with time and practice I began to develop real world applications. I had been going
                to school for a few semesters before I took an interest in software development, so my classes
                were not aimed toward any software related degrees. I updated my associate degree from ‘Science’
                to ‘Computer Programming’ after my new-found passion for software. Once I had switched my degree,
                I began to sign up for software development classes such as object-oriented programming, databases,
                web development, app design, networking, and many more. My next objective was to get some sort
                experience in the field since I knew it would take more than just passion to convince someone to
                hire me as a software developer. I managed convinced the IT manager at the manufacturing facility I worked at at the time to allow
                me to work for free along side the software developer in an exchange for experience. After some time
                had gone, I ended as a system administrator and eventually landed the role of software developer in
                that same company. The IT team consisted of only one software developer, so I was all alone with no
                help. This taught me many valuable lessons one of which was how to be independent. I much rather work
                on a team since, in my opinion, this is a more enjoyable way to develop great software.
                <br />
                <br />
                &emsp;&emsp;This is the story of how I got started as a software developer. I am grateful for my career because
                I love what I do for a living and I really enjoy soliving complicated problems and making life easier through great software. 
                Software develpment is a craft and I seek to improve at my craft everyday.
